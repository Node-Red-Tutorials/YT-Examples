Code Examples for the Node-Red-Tutorials YouTube Channel.

# Instructions
To use this code go to your Node-Red editor. Press in the top right corner on the Menu icon.
Go to import and select the `.json` file you want to import.

# Repository Structure
The Repository is structured using the following folders.

## Custom Examples
In the folder `00_Custom_Examples` you can find some tutorials i made based on follower requests.

## Common Nodes
In the folder `01_Common_Nodes` you find tutorials about all the common nodes of Node-Red.
Including the `Inject` and `Debug` node, which are in my opinion the most used node in Node-Red.

## Function Nodes
In the folder `02_Function_Nodes` you find tutorials about the widely used `switch` and `change` node.

## JavaScript Functions
In the folder `03_JavaScript_Nodes` there are some basic flows using the `function` node, which lets the user define custom JavaScript functions.
Making this node incredibly powerful.

## Dashboard
Next the `04_Dashboard` folder. It includes a tutorial for every normal node in the Node-Red Dashboard. Including the `template` and `ui control` node. Further extending the basic functionality using the `table` node.

## Communication
Next the `05_Communication` folder. In here we teach you how to communicate with the world in different ways. For example TCP.

## RPI
In the `06_RPI` folder, you will find node-red code based on a raspberry pi.
